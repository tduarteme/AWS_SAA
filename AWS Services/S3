# S3 - Buckets
    Naming convention
        No uppercase, no underscore
        3-63 characters long
        Not an IP
        Must start with lowercase letter or number
        No start with the prefix xn--
        No start end with the suffix -s3alias

    The key is composed of "prefix" + "object name"
    Max. Object Size is 5TB
    If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
    Version (if versioing is enable)

# S3 Security
    User - based
        IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for specific user from IAM
    
    Resource - based
        Bucket Policies - rules from the S3 console allows cross account
            JSON policies
            Resources - buckets and objects
            Effect - ALLOW / DENY
            Actions - Set of API to ALLOW or DENY
            Principal - the account or user to apply the policy
            Use the bucket policy.:
                to grant public access to the bucket
                Force objects to be encrypted at upload
                Grand access to another account (Cross Account)

        Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disable)
        Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disable)

    Note: IAM principal can access S3, if the user IAM permissions ALLOW or the resource policy ALLOW
        and there's no explicit DENY

    Encryption - using encryption keys

    "Grant access the services AWS on S3 - Use IAM roles"

# S3 Replication
    Must be enable versioning in source and destination buckets
    Asynchronous replication between buckets
    Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
    Buckets can be in different accounts

    Cross Region Replication (CRR)
        Compliance, lowe latency access, replication across accounts

    Same Region Replication (SRR)
        log aggregation, live replication between production and test account

    After enble replication, only new objects are replicated, to replicate existing objects use S3 "batch replication" (existing objects and failed replication)

# S3 Classes
    Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle
    Durability 11 9's across multiple AZ

    Standard - General Purpose
        99.99% availability
        Used for frequently accessed data
        Low latency and high throughput
        Use cases - Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution

    Infrequent Access
        For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
        Low cost that Standard

    S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
        99.9% Availability
        Use cases - DR, backups

    S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
        High durability (11 9's) in sigle AZ, (negative - data lost when AZ is destroyed)
        99.5% Availability
        Use cases - Storing secondary backup copies of on-promise data or data can reacreate

# S3 Glacier Storage Classes
    Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
    Pricee for storage + object retrieval cost

    Glacier Instant Retrieval
        Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter (15')
        Minium storage duration of 90 days

    Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)
        Expedited (1 to 5'), Standard (3 to 5 hours), bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
        Minium storage duration of 90 days

    Glacier Deep Archive - long term storage
        Standard (12 hours), bulk (48 hours)
        Minium storage duration of 180 days

    S3 Intelligent Tiering
        Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
        Move object automatically between access tiers based on usage
        There'nt retrieval

        Frequent Access (automatic): defauilt tier
        Infrequent Access: not accessed for 30 days
        Archive Instant Access: " 90 days
        Archive Access (optinal): configurable from 90 to 700 + days
        Deep Archive Access (optinal): config. from 180 to 700 + days

# Request Pays
    Mode Standard,the bucket owner pay all request
    Request Pays, the request that pay, help when want to share large datasets with other accounts.

# S3 Performance
    Multi-Part Upload
        recommend for files > 100MB
        must use for files > 5GB

    S3 Transfer Accleration
        Transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location
        Compatible with Multi-part Upload

# Storage Lens
    Understand, analyze, and optimize storage across entire AWS Organization
    Discover anomalies, identify cost efficiencies and apply data protetion best practices across AWS Organization

# S3 Encryption
    SSE - S3
        Keys handled, managed and omned by AWS
        Type is AES-256, enable default for new buckets or objects
        Must set header " x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256"
    
    SSE-KMS
        Keys handled and managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
        Advantages: user control + audit key usage CloudTrail
        Object is encrypted server side
        Must set header " x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:KMS"
        "KMS Limitation" - Upload and Download can have count call, quota (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region)

    SSE-C
        Server-Side-Encryption using keys fully managed by the customer ouside of AWS
        S3 doesn't store the encryption key
        HTTPS must be used

    Client-Side Encryption
        Clients must encrypt data themselves before sendind to S3
        " must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
        Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
        "With Client-Side Encryption, you have to do the encryption yourself and you have full control over the encryption keys. 
        You perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS. 
        AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data."

    Encryption in transit SSL/TLS
        Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS
        S3 exposes two endpoints
            HTTP - no encrypted
            HTTPS - encrypted in flight, is recommended
                is mandatory for SSE-C

        * Force Encryption in Transit
            Using bucket policy
                " aws:Secure Transport": "false" "= HTTPS"

# S3 Access Logs
    For audit purpose, log all access to S3
    Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied
    Can be analyzed using data analysis Athena

# CORS
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
        Web browser security that allow to enable images, asserts or files from one S3 in case the request is originating from another origin
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. To learn more about CORS, go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html

# S3 - Pre-Signed URL
    Generate URL using the Console, CLI or SDK
    URL Expiration
        Console - 1 min to 12hours
        CLI - configure expiration with --paramenter in seconds

    Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the user that generated the URL GET/PUT (Bucket Private)

# S3 Glacier Vault Lock
    WORM (Write Once Read Many)
    Help for compliance and data retention
    Versioning must enable

    Retention mode - Compliance
        Objects can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, incluing root user
        Retention modes can't be changed, retention periods can't be shortened

    Retention mode - Governance
        Most users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings
        Some users have special permissions to change the retention or delete the object

    Retention Period
        Protect the object for a fixed period, it can be extended

    Legal Hold
        Protect the object indefinitely, independent from retention period
        can be freely placed and removed using the "s3:PutObjectLegalHold" IAM permission
