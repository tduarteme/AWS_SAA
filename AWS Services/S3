# S3 - Buckets
    Naming convention
        No uppercase, no underscore
        3-63 characters long
        Not an IP
        Must start with lowercase letter or number
        No start with the prefix xn--
        No start end with the suffix -s3alias

    The key is composed of "prefix" + "object name"
    Max. Object Size is 5TB
    If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
    Version (if versioing is enable)

# S3 Security
    User - based
        IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for specific user from IAM
    
    Resource - based
        Bucket Policies - rules from the S3 console allows cross account
            JSON policies
            Resources - buckets and objects
            Effect - ALLOW / DENY
            Actions - Set of API to ALLOW or DENY
            Principal - the account or user to apply the policy
            Use the bucket policy.:
                to grant public access to the bucket
                Force objects to be encrypted at upload
                Grand access to another account (Cross Account)

        Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disable)
        Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disable)

    Note: IAM principal can access S3, if the user IAM permissions ALLOW or the resource policy ALLOW
        and there's no explicit DENY

    Encryption - using encryption keys

    "Grant access the services AWS on S3 - Use IAM roles"

# S3 Replication
    Must be enable versioning in source and destination buckets
    Asynchronous replication between buckets
    Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
    Buckets can be in different accounts

    Cross Region Replication (CRR)
        Compliance, lowe latency access, replication across accounts

    Same Region Replication (SRR)
        log aggregation, live replication between production and test account

    After enble replication, only new objects are replicated, to replicate existing objects use S3 "batch replication" (existing objects and failed replication)

# S3 Classes
    Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle
    Durability 11 9's across multiple AZ

    Standard - General Purpose
        99.99% availability
        Used for frequently accessed data
        Low latency and high throughput
        Use cases - Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution

    Infrequent Access
        For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
        Low cost that Standard

    S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
        99.9% Availability
        Use cases - DR, backups

    S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
        High durability (11 9's) in sigle AZ, (negative - data lost when AZ is destroyed)
        99.5% Availability
        Use cases - Storing secondary backup copies of on-promise data or data can reacreate

# S3 Glacier Storage Classes
    Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
    Pricee for storage + object retrieval cost

    Glacier Instant Retrieval
        Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter (15')
        Minium storage duration of 90 days

    Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)
        Expedited (1 to 5'), Standard (3 to 5 hours), bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
        Minium storage duration of 90 days

    Glacier Deep Archive - long term storage
        Standard (12 hours), bulk (48 hours)
        Minium storage duration of 180 days

    S3 Intelligent Tiering
        Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
        Move object automatically between access tiers based on usage
        There'nt retrieval

        Frequent Access (automatic): defauilt tier
        Infrequent Access: not accessed for 30 days
        Archive Instant Access: " 90 days
        Archive Access (optinal): configurable from 90 to 700 + days
        Deep Archive Access (optinal): config. from 180 to 700 + days
