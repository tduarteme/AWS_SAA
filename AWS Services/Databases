# RDS

                Managed PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MariaDB and Custom

                Provisioned RDS Instance Size EBSVolume type and size

                AS capability for storage

                Support Read Replicas and MultiAZ

                IAM, SG, KMS, SSL in transit

                Automated Backup with point time restore (up to 35 days)

RDS Custom for access Oracle & SQL Server

 

# Aurora

                Compatible PostgreSQL and MySQL

                Storage in 6 replicas, across 3AZs – HA self-fealing, AS

                Cluster across multiple AZ, AG, Read Replicas

 

                Aurora Serveless – for unpredictable and intermittent workload, no capacity planning

 

                Aurora Global – 16 DB Read Intances in each region, <1 second storage replication

 

                Aurora ML -Using SageMaker & Comprehend on Aurora

 

                Aurora Database Cloning – New cluster from existing one, faster than restoring a snashot

 

                Use cases: Same as RDS, less maintenance, more flexibility, more performance and more features

 

# Amazon Elastic Cache

                Managed Redis / Memcache (similar as RDS, but for caches)

                In memory data store, sub-millisecond latency

                Clustering (Redis) and Multi AZ, Read Replicas (sharding)

                IAM, SG, KMS and Redis Auth

                Backup, Snapshot and point restore

 

                Use cases: Key/Value store, frequent reads, less writes, cache results for DB queries, store session data for websites, cannot use SQL.

 

# DynamoDB

                AWS proprietary, managed serverless NoSQL, millisecond latency

                Provisioned capacity with optional AS or on-demand capacity

                Replace Elastic Cache as a Key/Value (store session data, using TTL feature)

                HA, MultiAZ by default, read e write decoupled, transaction capability

                DAX cluster for read cache, microsecond read latency

                Authetication and authorization is done through IAM

                Event Processing – DynamoDB Streams to integrate with Lambda or Kiness Data Streams

                Global Table feature

                Great to rapidly evolve schemas

 

                Use cases: Serveless applications development (small documents 100s KB) distributed serverless cache

 

# S3

                Key/Value store objects

                Great for bigger objects, no so great for smaller objects

                Serverless, scales, max object size is 5TB, versoning capability

 

                Use cases: Bigger and static files, website hosting

 

# DocumentDB

                Same for MongoDB (NoSQL)

                Used to store, query and index JSON data

                Similar “deployment concepts” Aurora

                Fully Managed, HA with replication across 3AZs

                Store automatically grows in increments of 10GB

                Automatically scales to workloads with millions of request per seconds

 

# Neptune

                Fully managed graph database

                Popular to social network

                               User friends

                               Posts have comments

                               Share and Likes posts

 

                HA across 3AZ with up to 15 read replicas

                Can store up to billions of relations and query the graph with milliseconds latency

                Great for knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendation engines, social networking

 

# Neptune – Streams

                Real-time ordered, no duplicates, strict order

                Streams data is accessible in an HTTP REST API

 

                Use cases: Send notifications when certain changes are made, maintain graph data synchronized in another data store

 

# Amazon Keyspaces (Apache Cassandra)

                Serverless, Scalable, HA, fully managed by AWS

                Automatically scale tables up/down based on the applications traffic

                Tables are replicated 3 times across multiple AZ

                On-demand or Provisioned with AS

 

                Use cases: IoT devices info, time-series data

 

# Amazon QLDB

                Quantum Ledger Database

                Recording financial transactions

                Fully managed, serverless, HA, replication across 3AZ

                Used to review history of all the changes made to application data over time

                2-3x performance

 

# Amazon Timestream

                Managed, fast, scalable, serveless time series database

                Automatically scales up/down to adjust capacity

                Store and analyze trillons of events per day

                Built -in time series analytics functions

 

                Use cases; IoT apps, operational applications, real-time analytics
