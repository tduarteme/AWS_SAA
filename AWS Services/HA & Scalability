# Vertical Scalability
    Incresing the size instance
    RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically

# Horizontal Scalability
    Incresing the number the instances
    Very common for web applications / modern applications
    Easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud (ALB,ALN)

# HA
    Run instances for the same application across multi Az
        ASG and ALB - multi AZ

# Elastic Load Balancing
    LB are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers
        Health Checks
            Crucial for LB
            They enable the LB to know if instances it forwards traffic to available to reply to request.
            Check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
            If instance no response is not (200 ok), then the instance is unhealthy

# Types LB
    *(Deprecated) Classic LB - HTTP. HTTPS, TCP, SSL

    ALB - HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket Layer 7
        Using ALB  to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances, the IP address you'll receive requests from will be the ALB's private IP addresses. 
            To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called "X-Forwarded-For" contains the client's IP address.

        ALBs can route traffic to different Target Groups based on URL Path, Hostname, HTTP Headers, and Query Strings.

    NLB - TCP, TLS, TCP, UDP
    GWLB - Operate ar layer 3 (network)


# Network Load Balancer
    Layer 4 - Transport
        forward TCP & UDP
        One static IP per AZ - Elastic IP
        Health Checks support the HTTP, HTTPS and TCP.
    Network Load Balancer has one static IP address per AZ and you can attach an Elastic IP address to it. 
    Application Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers have a static DNS name.
    NLB supports HTTP health checks as well as TCP and HTTPS

# Gateway Load Balancer
    Layer 3 - Network
    Deploy, scale and manage.
    Firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
    Geneve protocol port 6081

# Sticky Sessions
    The cookie used for stickiness has an expiration date control
    User doesn't lose his session data

    Application-based Cookies
        Don't use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)

# SSL/TLS
    SSL certificate allow traffic between clients, LB to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encrption)
        SSL - Secure Sockets Layer - encrypt connections - ahve an expiration data (you set)
        TLS - Tranport Layer Security

    LB - SSL Certicates
        LB use an X.509 certificates (SSL/TLS server certificate)
        Can manage certificates using ACL (AWS Certificate Manager)

    SSL Server Name Indication "SNI"
        solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates (serve multiples website)
        "newer" protocol, requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server
        Only works with ALB, NLB and Cloud Front
        Server Name Indication (SNI) allows you to expose multiple HTTPS applications each with its own SSL certificate on the same listener. Read more here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/

# Cross-Zone LB
    When Cross-Zone Load Balancing is enabled, ELB distributes traffic evenly across all registered EC2 instances in all AZs.

# Auto Scaling Group - ASG - It's FREE
    Scale out, increase Instances
    Scale in, remove Instances
    Ensure minumum and maxium number pf EC2 running
    Re-create an EC2 in case one is terminated (unhealth)
