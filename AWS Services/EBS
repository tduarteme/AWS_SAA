# Elastic Block Store
    Persist data
    Specific AZ
    Free Tier 30GB General Purpose SSD
    To move a volume cross, first need to snapshot
    *Multi-attach - 16 instances

# EBS Delete on Termination attribute
    Enable volume root(Disk Ephemeral) and Disable volume EBS.

# Snapshot
    Archive Tier - 75% cheaper
        24 to 72 hours for restore

    Recycle Bin
        Retain deletes snapshots, can recover them after accidetaton deletion
        Retention 1 day to 1 year

    Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
        Force full initialization, no latency and expensive.

# AMI - Amazon Machine Image
    Start EC2 instance and customize it 
    Buid an AMI - this will create EBS snapshot
    AMI GOLDEN - Include all dependencias

# Instance Store
    High Performance hardware disk
    Better I/O Performance
    If terminate or stop, the disk is lose
    Goof for buffer / cache / scratch data / tempory content
    
# EBS Volumes Types
    gp2/3 SSD - General purpose that balance price and performance of workloads (boot volumes)
        1Gib - 16 TiB
        gp2:
            3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB
            MAX IOPS 16,000
            can burst IOPS to 3000

        gp3:
            3000 IOPS throughtput od 125 MiB/s
            Can increase IOPS 16000 and throughtput up to 1000 MiB/s
    
    io1/2 Block Express SSD - High Performance for mission-critical, low-latency or high throughput
        io1: (4GiB - 16 TiB)
            MAX Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) - 64000 for Nitro EC2 and 32000 for other
            Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size

        io2: (4GiB - 16 TiB)
            sub millisecond latency
            MAX PIOPS 256000
            Support EBS Multi-attach

    (Cannot be a boot volume)
    st1 HDD - Low cost designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workload
        Big data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing
        Max throughtput 500 Mib/s - max IOPS 500

    sc1 HDD Low cost desined for less frequently accessed workload
        data is infrequently accessed
        scenarios where lowest cost is important
        MAX throughtput 250 MiB/s - MAX IOPS 250

# EBS Multi-Attach io1/2
    Attach same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instance in the same AZ
    Intance has full read & write permissions to the high-performance volume
    UP 16 intances at time
    Must use a file system that's cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4)

    Case use:
        DHigher application availability, applications must manage concurrent write operations

# EBS Encryption
    leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
    copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption

# Amazon EFS
    Network File System - can be mounted on many EC2
    Multi-AZ
    Highly Available, scalable, expensive

    Standard: Regional
        Multi-AZ, great for PROD
        
    One Zone:
        Great for dev, backup, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)

    Use case:
        Content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress
        SG to control acccess to EFS
        Linux based
        Encryption at rest using KMS
