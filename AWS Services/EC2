    Default.:
        Inbound Block
        Outbound Allow

# EC2 User Data
    Bash script that install required, bootstrap.

# Compute Optimized
    Great for compute-intensive, workloads required HPC (High Performance Compute)

# EC2 On Demand
    Pay for what you use:
        Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where we can´t predict how the application will behave.

# Reserved Instances
    72% discount compared to On-demand
    Period 1(+discount) or 3 (+++discount) years
    Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
    Can buy and sell in Marketplace

# Saving Plans
    1 or 3 years

# Spot Instances
    90% discount compared to On-demand
    Most cost-efficient in AWS
    Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
        Batch Jobs
        Data analysis
        Image Processing
        Workloads with flexible start and end time
        Less reliable because you can lose EC2

# Dedicated Host
    Physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
    Allow Compliance requirements and use your existing server bound software licenses
    Great fot companies that have strong regulatory or compliance.

# Spot Fleets
    Fleets = Spot + On-demand instances
    Try meet the target capacity with price constraints
    LowestPrice, diversified, capacityOptimized, price Capacity Optimized
    Fleets allow to automatically request Spot Instances

# Elastic IP
    Can only have 5 Elastic IP account.
    Attach fix IP on EC2
    * Load Balancer don't use IP.

# Placement Group
    Control over the EC2 Instance
        Cluster - Instance low-latency group in single AZ, 10 Gbps network. (If the Az fail, all instances fails, don't HA)
        Spread - Instance across underçying hardware (max 7 instances per group/AZ) critical applications - use HA
        Partition - Instances across many different partitions - applications as Hadoop, Cassandra and Kafka - 
7 partitions per AZ

# Elatic Network Interface - ENI
    Logical component in a VPC
    Can create an ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them), EC2 intances for failover
    Specific availability zone.

# EC2 Hibernate
    Instance Families - C3,4,5,I3,M3,4,R3,4.T2,3
    RAM Size - Less than 150GB
    Don't supported for bare metal instances
    Root EBS - must be encrypted, not instance store and large
    Available for On-Demand, Reserved ans Spot Instance
    Instance can't be hibernated more than 60 days
