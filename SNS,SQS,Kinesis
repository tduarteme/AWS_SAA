# Amazon SQS - Standard Queue
    Oldest over 10 years
    Fully managed service, use decouple applications
    Defaul retention 4 days, maxium of 14 days
    low latency <10ms
    Limitation of 256KB
    Unlimited number of throughputs
    Encryption using HTTPS API, KMS keys

# SQS Timeout
    Defaul 30 seconds
    Message not processed, it will be procced twice

# SQS - Long Polling
    When a consumer request messages from the queue, it can optionally "wait"
    for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue, this is Polling
    Great to short Polling, optimize the number of API calls

# SQS - FIFO Queue
    First in First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
    Limited throughput 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with
    Message are procced in order

# Amazon SNS
    Only sends message (Simple Notification Service)
    Up to 12.500.000 subscriptions per topic
    100.000 topics limit
    Integrate services SQS, Lambda, kinesis Data Firehouse and others
    Encryption using HTTPS API, KMS keys

# Kinesis
    Collext, process and analyze streaming data in real-time
    Ingest real-time data such as Application logs, Metrics, Website clickstreams, IoT

        Kinesis Data Streams: capture, process and store data streams
            Real time
            Big data, can be scale per shares
            Retention between 1 day to 365 days
            Managed: Lambda, Kinesis data firehose and Data Analytics
            Capacity Modes
                Provisioned and On-demand


        Kinesis Data Firehose: Load data streams into AWS data store
            Near real time
            Fully Managed, automatic scaling and serveless
            AWS into: Redshift, S3 and Open Search
            3ยบ partner: Splunk / MongoDB, Datadog
            Send only HTTP endpoint
            Buffer 0 seconds to 900 seconds
            Buffer size: minimun 1MB

        Kinesis Data Analytics: Analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink

        Kinesis Video Streams: Capture, process and store video streams

# Amazon MQ
    SQS and SNS are cloud native AWS
    Application running from on-promises may use open protocols
    such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire and WSS
    MQ is managed message broker service for "RABBITMQ and ACTIVE MQ"
    Doesn't scale as much SQS/SNS
    Run on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
