# Snow Family
    Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge and migrate adata into and out of AWS
"If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball Devices"

Data Migration.:
    Snowcone
        Use cases: sent back to AWS offline or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data
        Small, portable Computing
        Used for edge computing, storage and data transfer
        8TB HDD Storage
        14TB SSD Storage
        Snowcone where Snowball doesn't fit
        Provide battery/cables



    Snowball Edge (for data transfer)
        No cannot import to Glacier directly, use S3 first e after the S3 lifecycle
        Use cases: large data migration, DC decommission and DR.
        move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
        Compatible with S3
        Pay per data transfer job
            Storage Optimized
                80TB pf HDD or 210TB NVMe capacity
            Compute Optimized
                42TB of HDD or 28TB NVMe


    Snowballmobile
        AWS truck
        Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1.000 PB = 1.000.000 TBs)
        Capacity 100 PB
        Better than smallball if transfer more than 10 PB

# Edge Computing
    Process data while it's being created on an edge location - truck, ship mining station
    Use cases: Preprocess data, machine learning at the edge, transconding media streams
    These location may have - edge location
        Limited / no internet access
        Limited / no easy access to computing power

# OpsHub - Software*

# NetAPP ONTAP - Storage Software
    Data management and access capabilities
    Compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol

# OpenZFS
    Open source storage plataform that combines the functionality file system and volume manager
    Compatible with NFS (v3, v4 ... v4.2)
    Up to 1.000.000 IOPS <0.5 latency
    Point in time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

# Storage Gateway
    Hybrid Cloud
    Use cases, DR, backup & restore, tiered storage, on-premises cache & low-latency files access

# S3 File Gateway
    Use when S3 need connect with on-promise
    Support classes, Standard, Standard IA, One Zone IA and Intelligent Tiering
    Transition to Glacier, enable lifecycle policy
    Access Buckets with roles
    SMB integration with AD, must have user authentication

# File Gateway
    Local cache, use when want connect FSx with on-promise

# Volume Gateway
    Backed EBS snapshots can help restore on-promises volume
    Cached volumes - low latency access to most recent data
    Stored volumes - entire datase is on-promises, scheduled backups to S3

# Tape Gateway
    Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes
    Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed S3 and Glacier

# Transfer Family
    Support Protocols
        FTP, FTPS (over SSL), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
        Use: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP
        HA, multi-AZ, Scalable, Reliable

# AWS DataSync
    Move large amount of data to and from
    On-promises / other cloud to AWS - needs agent
    AWS to AWS (different storage service)  - no agent
    Synchronize S3, EFS, FSx
    Replication task can be, hr, daily or weekly
    One agent can use 10Gbps, can setup bandwidth limit
    "AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services"
